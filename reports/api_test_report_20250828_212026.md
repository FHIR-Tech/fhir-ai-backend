   Email: admin@healthtech.com
   Role: SystemAdministrator
   Tenant: default
   Password Hash: $2a$11$92IXUNpkjO0rO...

⚠️ Note: Direct database insertion requires:
   1. Database access credentials
   2. Proper password hashing (using pgcrypto)
   3. UUID generation for user ID
   4. Proper tenant isolation

🔧 Alternative Approaches:
   1. Create a database migration script
   2. Add a development-only admin endpoint
   3. Use Entity Framework seeding
   4. Create a setup wizard for first-time installation

🔐 Testing Login with Created User...

❌ Login failed
✨ User creation process completed!

📝 Next Steps:
   1. Create a database migration to insert test users
   2. Add a development-only admin setup endpoint
   3. Implement proper password hashing in the application
   4. Test the complete authentication flow
